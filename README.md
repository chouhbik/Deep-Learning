# Deep-Learning
Preprocessing with Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Network.

# Implementation and Environment
All assignments are in python and implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
I used for this notebooks my local server in my computrer, but if you find some difficulties with running some some parts of the code, you still can use Google Colab for speeding up training because of powerful Nvidia GPUs on Google Cloud.
