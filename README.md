# Deep-Learning
Preprocessing with Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Network.

# Implementation and Environment
All assignments are in python and implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
I used Google Colab for speeding up training because of powerful Nvidia GPUs on Google Cloud. please visit <a href ="acm.ut.ac.ir/deeplearning">colab.resreach.google.com</a>.

# Topics
Fully Connected Neural Network,Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative Adversarial Network and some preprocessing.
